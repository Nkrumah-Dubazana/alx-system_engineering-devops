# Shell Scripting: Loops, Conditions, and Key Generation

![Shell Scripting](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/individual.sh-for-loop-script.png)

## Introduction

This project focuses on learning essential shell scripting concepts, including the creation of SSH keys, utilization of various loop structures (`while`, `until`, and `for`), implementation of conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case`), and application of the `cut` command. Understanding these concepts is fundamental for effective script development in a Unix-like environment.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Create SSH keys using the `ssh-keygen -t rsa` command.
- Differentiate between using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `#!/bin/bash` at the beginning of a script.
- Implement `while`, `until`, and `for` loops to iterate through data or perform repetitive tasks.
- Utilize `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case` conditional statements for decision-making in scripts.
- Apply the `cut` command to extract specific fields or sections from text data.
- Understand file comparison operators and other comparison techniques in shell scripting.

## Project Requirements

- Editors: You are allowed to use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- Environment: Scripts will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`.
- File Formatting: Ensure all files end with a newline character.
- README: Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Script Executability: All Bash script files must be executable.
- Restrictions: Avoid using `awk` in your scripts.
- Shellcheck Compatibility: Ensure your Bash scripts pass `Shellcheck` (version 0.7.0) without any errors.
- Script Header: The first line of all Bash scripts should start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, followed by a comment explaining the script's purpose.
  
## Key Concepts Covered

- `env`: Understanding the environment variables and their role in shell scripting.
- `cut`: Utilizing the `cut` command to extract specific columns or fields from text data.
- Looping Constructs:
  - `for`: Iterating over a list of items or sequences.
  - `while`: Executing a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true.
  - `until`: Executing a block of code repeatedly until a condition becomes true.
- Conditional Statements:
  - `if`: Making decisions based on conditions and executing specific code blocks accordingly.
