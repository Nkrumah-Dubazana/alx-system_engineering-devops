# Networking Basics #0

This project serves as an introductory exploration of networking concepts, focusing on the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. OSI model**
  * [0-OSI_model](./0-OSI_model): Text file answering questions regarding the OSI model, including its definition and organization.

* **1. Types of network**
  * [1-types_of_network](./1-types_of_network): Text file addressing different types of networks and scenarios.

* **2. MAC and IP address**
  * [2-MAC_and_IP_address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address): Text file clarifying the concepts of MAC and IP addresses.

* **3. UDP and TCP**
  * [3-UDP_and_TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP): Text file discussing UDP and TCP protocols.

* **4. TCP and UDP ports**
  * [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports): Bash script displaying listening ports, showing only listening sockets, and providing PID and program name information.

* **5. Is the host on the network**
  * [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network): Bash script pinging an IP address five times.

These tasks provide a foundational understanding of networking concepts, preparing for further exploration in subsequent projects.
