This project delves further into understanding IP addresses while honing skills in manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Change your home IP**
  * [0-change_your_home_IP](./0-change_your_home_IP): Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server to resolve `localhost` to `127.0.0.2` and `facebook.com` to `8.8.8.8`.

* **1. Show attached IPs**
  * [1-show_attached_IPs](./1-show_attached_IPs): Bash script displaying all active IPv4 IP addresses on the machine.

* **2. Port listening on localhost**
  * [100-port_listening_on_localhost](./100-port_listening_on_localhost): Bash script listening on port `98` on `localhost`.

These tasks enhance understanding of IP addresses and facilitate practical experience in IP manipulation using Bash scripts.
