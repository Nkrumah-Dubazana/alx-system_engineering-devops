# Web Stack Debugging #0

This project marks the beginning of a series focused on debugging web stacks. Each task involves fixing broken or bugged web stacks in isolated containers. For each task, I provide a script automating the commands necessary to restore the web stack to a working state.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that starts Apache on a web server and ensures it responds to queries to the root.
